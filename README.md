**NOTE: the Registry source code has been merged into Elixir and will be included in Elixir v1.4.**

# Registry

A local, decentralized and scalable key-value process storage. [See the documentation](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/elixir/Registry.html).

This is a proposal implementation to be included as part of Elixir v1.4.

## License

Same as Elixir.
